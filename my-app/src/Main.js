            <p>Assuis is a place to help you talk about your <strong>emotions</strong>. There are steps to doing that. First, you need to know the right words, and then you need someone to listen, or multiple people, even! Most importantly, you need to feel comfortable sharing those experiences, thoughts, and emotions. No other way to feel comfortable or reassured--than to know it's not just you feeling those hefty or hazzy feelings, others as well are on the same boat...and you all didn't know until right now.</p>
